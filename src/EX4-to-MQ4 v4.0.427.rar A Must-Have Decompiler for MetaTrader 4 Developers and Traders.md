# EX4 to MQ4 Decompiler: What You Need to Know
 
If you are a forex trader who uses MetaTrader 4 (MT4) platform, you may have encountered EX4 files. These are executable files that contain trading robots, technical indicators and scripts for the MT4 terminal. They are compiled from the source code files in MQ4 format using the MetaEditor program.
 
However, sometimes you may need to access the source code of an EX4 file, for example, to modify it, to understand its logic, or to learn from it. This is where a decompiler comes in handy. A decompiler is a tool that can reverse-engineer an executable file and recover its source code. In this case, a decompiler can convert an EX4 file back to an MQ4 file.

## How to Use a Decompiler
 
The most popular and widely used decompiler for EX4 files is EX4 to MQ4 Decompiler. It is a standalone program that can decompile any EX4 file and save its source code as an MQ4 file. The decompilation process is automatic and does not require any user intervention.

However, there is a catch. The decompiler can only work with EX4 files that were compiled by MetaTrader builds no higher than 600. This means that the files should be created in 2013 or earlier. This can be easily checked by looking at the date of file creation.
 
The reason for this limitation is that in 2014, MetaQuotes, the developer of MT4, released a new build 600 that changed the way programs are compiled. Instead of compiling them into EX4 files, they are now compiled directly into binary code. This makes them more secure and faster, but also impossible to decompile automatically.
 
## What Are the Alternatives?
 
If you need to decompile an EX4 file that was created after 2013 or downloaded from the MQL Market as a demo version, you will not be able to use the decompiler. However, this does not mean that decompilation is impossible. It just means that it requires more time and effort.
 
There are specialized online services that offer manual decompilation of EX4 files by qualified experts. They use professional reverse-engineering tools such as debuggers and disassemblers to analyze the binary code and reconstruct the source code. One of the best known such services is EX4toMQ4.pro, which has been operating since 2005.
 
To order decompilation of an EX4 file from this service, you need to fill in a form on their website and upload your file. The price depends on the complexity and size of the file, but it usually ranges from $50 to $200 per file. The turnaround time is also variable, but it usually takes from one day to one week.
 
## Conclusion
 
EX4 files are executable files that contain trading robots, technical indicators and scripts for the MT4 platform. They are compiled from MQ4 source code files using the MetaEditor program.
